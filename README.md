Project template for TypeScript libraries

### Quick Start

1. Enable [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html#enabling-the-feature)

2. Run these commands:

   ```
   ❯ gh repo clone jasonkuhrt/template-typescript-lib <directory> && \
       cd <directory> && \
       yarn install && \
       yarn ts-node scripts/bootstrap
   ```

3. [Setup a repo secret ](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) called `NPM_TOKEN` containing an [npm token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens) for CI package publishing.

Example:

```
❯ gh repo clone jasonkuhrt/template-typescript-lib alge && \
    cd alge && \
    yarn && \
    yarn ts-node scripts/bootstrap
```

```

### Features

#### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for Type Safety & Productivity

1.  Optimal settings for the safety of your implementation

    1. [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) mode enabled.
    1. All lint flags enabled:
       - [`noImplicitReturns`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitReturns)
       - [`noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noFallthroughCasesInSwitch)
       - [`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noUncheckedIndexedAccess)
       - [`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature)
       - [`noImplicitOverride`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitOverride)

1.  `.tsbuildinfo` cache setup, output discretely into `node_modules/.cache`

1.  Inherit settings from [`@tsconfig/recommended` (Node 14 flavour)](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases#node-16-tsconfigjson)

1.  Base `tsconfig.json` shared across `tests`, `src`, and `ts-node`.

1.  [`ts-patch`](https://github.com/nonara/ts-patch) setup for enhanced language features:

    1. [`typescript-transform-paths`](https://github.com/LeDDGroup/typescript-transform-paths) for a **_working_** [tsconfig `paths` config](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths)!
    1. Intentional avoidance of [`ttypescript`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38365#issuecomment-921889655)

1.  Optimal output setup for your users

    1. Target ES2020 which Node as low as version 14 has good support for ([Kangax compatibility table](https://node.green/#ES2019)).
    1. [`declaration`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#declaration) so your users can power their intellisense with your packages typings.
    1. [`declarationMap`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#declarationMap) enabled to make your published source code be navigated to when your users use "go to definition".
    1. `package.json` [`typeVersions`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html#version-selection-with-typesversions) used to emit only **one** set of declaration files shared by both CJS and ESM builds.
    1. [`sourceMap`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#sourceMap) enabled to allow your users' tools to base off the source for e.g. stack traces instead of the less informative derived built JS.
    1. [`importHelpers`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importHelpers) enabled to minimize build size.
    1. Publish `src` with dist files so that jump-to-definition tools work optimally for users.

1.  `ts-node` for running TypeScript scripts/modules.

    1. [Setup to use SWC](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/transpilers/#swc) for maximum speed.

#### [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) For Linting

1.  TypeScript integration
1.  TS type-checker powered eslint checks enabled
1.  Prettier integration using just [`eslint-config-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier). [`eslint-plugin-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) is _not_ used to avoid lint noise and slower run time. Prettier is expected to be run by your IDE and your CI and if really needed _you manually_ via `yarn format`.
1.  Setup as a CI check for PRs
1.  Always display as warning to keep IDE error feedback for TypeScript (CI enforces warnings).
1.  Auto-fixable import sorting

#### [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for Testing

1. Transpile TypeScript tests with [`@swc/jest`](https://github.com/swc-project/jest)
1. Useful watch mode plugins
   1. [`jest-watch-typeahead`](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-watch-typeahead)
   1. [`jest-watch-suspend`](https://github.com/unional/jest-watch-suspend)
   1. [`jest-watch-select-projects`](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-watch-select-projects)
1. `jest.config.ts` (TypeScript file) for type safe & intellisense configuration.
1. [`typescript-snapshots-plugin`](https://github.com/asvetliakov/typescript-snapshots-plugin) for viewing snapshots on hover of `.toMatchSnapshot` method.
1. [`konn`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/konn) for type safe test context creation.
1. Strongly typed Jest configuration via use of `@jest/types`

#### [Dripip](https://github.com/prisma-labs/dripip) for Releasing

#### Simple succinct friendly low-barrier issue templates

1.  Emojis ✈️
1.  Feature / bug / docs / something-else
1.  Config to display discussions link right in new issue type listing UI

#### [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting

1.  Prisma Labs config preset, 110 line width
1.  Setup as a CI check for PRs
1.  [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) in recommended extensions list so that when collaborators open the project they'll get prompted to install it if they haven't already.
1.  npm script

#### npm scripts for development lifecycle

1.  `clean` to remove cache and dist files
1.  `build` that runs `clean` beforehand
1.  `prepublishOnly` that runs `build` beforehand
1.  `format` to quickly run `prettier` over whole codebase
1.  `lint` to quickly run `eslint` over whole codebase

#### CI with GitHub Actions

1.  Separate trunk and pull-request (PR) workflows.
1.  [Dependency install cache](https://github.com/actions/setup-node/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages-dependencies) enabled.
1.  On PR:
    1.  Prettier Check
    1.  Lint Check
    1.  Tests across matrix of mac/linux/windows for Node 14/16
1.  On trunk:
    1. Tests across matrix of mac/linux/windows for Node 14/16
    1. Automated canary release

#### [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) configuration

1.  JSON Schema setup for optimal intellisense
1.  Group all non-major devDependency updates into single PR (which "chore" conventional commit type)
1.  Group all major devDependency updates into single PR (with "chore" conventional commit type)
1.  Group all non-major dependency updates into single PR (with "deps" conventional commit type)
1.  Each major dependency update in own PR (with "deps" conventional commit type)

#### [Yarn 2](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for package management

1.  Painless/familiar workflow via `node_modules` for `nodeLinker`
1.  Using [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html#enabling-the-feature). This means the Yarn specified in `package.json` will be used. And note this is a Yarn binary shipped with Node now. In a future version of Node you will not need to even opt-in into Corepack. Make sure you've done `corepack enable` at least once.
1.  Plugins:
    1.  [`plugin-outdated`](https://github.com/mskelton/yarn-plugin-outdated) Bring back `outdated` command from Yarn 1.
    1.  [`plugin-typescript`](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/tree/master/packages/plugin-typescript) for painless `@types` consumptions (e.g. You probably forget how to pull down `@types` packages for already-scoped npm packages, doesn't matter now).
    1.  [`plugin-interactive-tools`](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/tree/master/packages/plugin-interactive-tools) for some slick in-terminal project maintenance.

#### CJS+ESM Hybrid package build

See [Dr. Axel's article about this](https://2ality.com/2019/10/hybrid-npm-packages.html))

1.  Use `exports` field to give support to both modern `import` and legacy `require` consumers using Node 12.x and up. For details about the `exports` field refer to the [Official Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_package_entry_points) about it.
1.  Use `main` field for legacy versions of Node (before `12.x`) requiring the CJS build.
1.  Use `module` field for legacy bundlers importing the ESM build.

#### VSCode Settings

1.  Optimize project search by ignoring `dist-*/`, `.yarn/`, snapshots, lock files, and more.
1.  On-Save actions for optimal editing experience (e.g. ESLint auto-fix to [organize imports automatically](https://github.com/lydell/eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort#can-i-use-this-without-autofix))
1.  List of VSCode extensions that users who open the project will be prompted to install if they don't already.
1.  Enable `typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk` so that oneself and collaborators will get prompted to use the workspace version of TypeScript instead of the one in the editor.

#### Readme Table of Contents

1. Using [`markdown-toc`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc)
